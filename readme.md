# MCpal - A lightweight Minecraft Server manager :)

## What does it do?
- Automatic backups once a day (currently at 4am)
- Extendes features (while fully supporting the native commands) like manual backups
- It's possible to automatically run other programs (like Overviewer to generate a map out of your world) after each backup

## What are the benefits?
- Small application (<20 KB)
- Designed to provide function without a loss of performance
- Automate the things you would need to do by yourself otherwise
- Simplicity

## You are a potential user if...
- You only host one world
- You like to concentrate your system performance fully on minecraft instead of supporting tools
- Your server doesn't have that much power
- Other tools you know are to complicated

## Future ideas:
- [x] Implement automatic server backups.
- [x] Implement additional parameters to run other programs (like Overviewer).
- [ ] Implement dynamic parameters to use, such as the world-name or the current backup path.
- [ ] Implement the option to run external programs with parameters after a backup.
- [ ] Give an optional time-parameter when the backup starts.
- [ ] Add the possibility to do multiple backups a day.
- [ ] Space management: Set a size of the backup folder and automatically delete the oldest backups.
- [ ] Make a "once per month" and "once per year" backup.
