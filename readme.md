# MCpal - A lightweight Minecraft Server manager :)

## What does it do?
- Automatic backups once a day (currently at 4am)

## What are the benefits?
- Small application (11 KB)
- Runs smoothly on weak servers

## The future ideas to this app would be:
- [x] Implement automatic server backups.
- [ ] Give an optional time-parameter when the backup starts.
- [ ] Add the possibility to do multiple backups a day.
- [ ] Space management: Set a size of the backup folder and automatically delete the oldest backups.
- [ ] Make a "once per month" and "once per year" backup.
